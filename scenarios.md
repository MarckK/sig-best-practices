This short document list a set of scenarios that we are interested in using as references for finding best practices, missing gaps and tools that can help you to accelerate.

## Cloud-Native Scenarios
This scenarios are assuming that you have a Cloud-Native architecture, where several services will be deployed at the same time by different teams. 
Assuming that a continuous delivery approach is implemented, these scenarios list the expectations and actions performed from an organization point of view:

- Dealing with changes in distributed applications
- Adding new services to a distributed application
- Dealing with a platform change (cross-functional change) 
- A/B testing for a single service
- Coordinating A/B testing for a set of services
