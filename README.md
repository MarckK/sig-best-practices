## Overview 

Continuous Delivery is a goal for many organizations. Research shows that implementing continuous delivery practices boosts  organizational performance as well as strengthens organization culture. 
Nevertheless, today every organization that wants to achieve that is forced to go through the same cycle of trial and error and expensive learning before they can reach that goal. What makes this especially painful is the fact that many of the lessons that organizations end up learning were lessons that others had already learned before. For example lessons such as:
- What are good strategies for reducing blast radius of software changes?
- How can canaries help increase confidence in the delivery workflow?
